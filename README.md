2. Enter a city name when prompted (e.g. "New York, London").
3. The program will retrieve and display the current temperature, humidity, and weather description for the specified city.

Note: If the program fails to retrieve the weather data, an error message will be displayed.

## Regular Expression Pattern Matcher

'This code uses the Python regular expressions module re to match patterns in text strings.
It includes eight different patterns, each with an example string to be matched.
The patterns include matching dates, email addresses, URLs, phone numbers, passwords, and credit card numbers.'

To use the code, simply run the "Regular_expressions" file and observe the output.
If a match is found for a given pattern and text string, the matched portion of the string will be printed.
If no match is found, a message stating that no match was found will be printed instead.
